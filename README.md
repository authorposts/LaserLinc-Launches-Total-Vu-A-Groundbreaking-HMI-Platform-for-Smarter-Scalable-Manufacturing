In a decisive move that promises to reshape production quality across industries, LaserLinc today announced the release of Total Vu™, a fully scalable and adaptive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) platform. Designed to seamlessly integrate with ultrasonic, laser, and defect inspection equipment, Total Vu™ offers manufacturers real-time visibility, closed-loop control, and comprehensive data management—all within a single, intuitive interface.

As businesses prepare for peak summer production, the need for clear and accessible process oversight has never been greater. With Total Vu™, LaserLinc delivers a solution that meets the growing demand for efficiency, traceability, and precision.

<p><b>Transforming Measurement Into Meaningful Insight</b></p>

Traditional production systems often silo measurement tools, forcing operators to interpret multiple screens and separate systems. Total Vu™ changes that by unifying data from diverse sources—laser micrometers, ultrasonic gauges, flaw detection units—into a coherent, user-friendly HMI.

<p><b>The platform enables users to:</b></p>

Entirely customize dashboards
Trigger live alarms and notifications
Store historical logs for SPC and audits
Enable secure access for operators, supervisors, and engineers

This streamlined design translates raw data into clear, actionable insight—modernizing shop-floor communication and empowering faster decision-making.

<p><b>Scalable Design for Manufacturers on the Move</b></p>

One of Total Vu™’s core strengths is its modular architecture. Facilities can deploy it on a single production line and expand usage to multiple operations as demand grows. Whether integrating a standalone ultrasonic unit or combining laser, wall thickness, and defect detection systems, Total Vu™ adapts effortlessly—no costly overhauls required.

This flexibility enables companies to future-proof their investments, adding new measurement channels and analytics without having to start from scratch.

<p><b>Seamless Integration with Existing Systems</b></p>

Total Vu™ plays well with others. Using open protocols like OPC-UA, Modbus, and TCP/IP, it connects readily to PLCs, SCADA systems, and enterprise-level MES or ERP platforms. Real-time data sharing facilitates closed-loop control—enabling automatic adjustments to die settings, flow rates, or speed based on live measurement feedback.

This connectivity drives significant savings in scrap, setup time, and product deviations—metrics that matter most during high-output seasons.

<p><b>Enhancing Accuracy with Laser and Ultrasonic Pairing</b></p>

In many production environments, manufacturers rely on standalone measurement tools and manual cross-checks to ensure quality. Total Vu™ offers a smarter route: operators can overlay data from a <a href="https://laserlinc.com/measurement/">precise laser measuring device</a> with ultrasonic thickness readings—offering a full-diameter view in real-time.

Add a surface defect detection system, and Total Vu™ becomes a central hub for all of your dimensional oversight efforts, offering unmatched clarity and process control.

<p><b>Supervising Surface Integrity with Dimensional Flaw Detection</b></p>

Beyond diameter and thickness measurements, surface integrity is crucial—especially in industries like medical tubing or aerospace components. Total Vu™ supports the integration of 3D flaw detection tools like FlawSense™, enabling users to monitor dimensional anomalies and surface defects simultaneously.

A centralized system for laser dimensional inspection streamlines detection workflows—helping teams catch and address issues before parts move to the next stage.

<p><b>Designed With Operators in Mind</b></p>

Total Vu™ is built for real people, not just engineers. The interface is intuitive and touchscreen-ready, with drag-and-drop widgets, layered dashboards, help tooltips, and multilingual support. Roles and access can be defined to fit your structure—operators log in to run lines; managers get analytics dashboards.
This level of design focus reduces training time, improves engagement, and empowers front-line personnel to take ownership of quality.

<p><b>Anticipating Peak-Season Performance</b></p>

Summer often brings higher demand—and higher stakes. Material shifts, staff rotations, and rapid run-ups can introduce variability into the production process. Total Vu™ addresses these challenges head-on by providing:

Real-time monitoring for early detection
Centralized dashboards for full-line visibility
Secure audit trails for compliance reporting
Scalable deployment across plant locations

Companies that leverage Total Vu during high-output cycles gain stability, insight, and the confidence to scale without compromise.

<p><b>Backed by U.S.-Based Innovation and Support</b></p>

Total Vu™ joins LaserLinc’s suite of advanced, non-contact measurement systems—all designed and supported by a U.S.-based engineering team. From ultrasonic gauges to flaw detection platforms, LaserLinc’s commitment to open systems and responsive service empowers manufacturers to stay competitive and agile.
